    "Multithreading in Python is a programming technique that allows multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously.\n",

    "Another reason for using multithreading is to improve responsiveness. By running multiple tasks simultaneously,\n",

    "        \n",
    "    1.Increased Performance: Multithreading can enhance the performance of a program by allowing multiple\n",
    "      threads to execute concurrently. It is particularly beneficial in situations where there are tasks\n",
    "      that can be executed independently or where I/O operations are involved. By utilizing multiple threads,\n",
    "      the program can make better use of available system resources and complete tasks faster.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    2.Responsiveness and User Experience: Multithreading enables programs to remain responsive even when \n",
    "      performing time-consuming operations. By offloading such operations to separate threads, the main \n",
    "      thread can continue to respond to user input, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3.Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share memory and resources, making it easier\n",
    "      to exchange data between them. This facilitates efficient communication and data sharing, allowing \n",
    "      threads to work together on a common goal.\n",
